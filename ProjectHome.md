Pure Java edition of Monome **monocontrol** app with some additions and bug fixes:

  * integrated SevenUp's Looper (http://makingthenoise.com/sevenup/#Looper) as a new control object.

  * added an ableton clip launcher/looper control object, the easiest way to implement a looper with ableton clip follow actions. It also features a useful pattern recorder.



  * several bug fixes and improvements (more midi events, preset loading, closing midi ports on exit, only one java object per matrix...)
